# Scaffold Identity in ASP.NET Core projects

By [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT)

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-3.0"

ASP.NET Core provides [ASP.NET Core Identity](xref:security/authentication/identity) as a [Razor Class Library](xref:razor-pages/ui-class). Applications that include Identity can apply the scaffolder to selectively add the source code contained in the Identity Razor Class Library (RCL). You might want to generate source code so you can modify the code and change the behavior. For example, you could instruct the scaffolder to generate the code used in registration. Generated code takes precedence over the same code in the Identity RCL. To gain full control of the UI and not use the default RCL, see the section [Create full identity UI source](#full).

Applications that do **not** include authentication can apply the scaffolder to add the RCL Identity package. You have the option of selecting Identity code to be generated.

Although the scaffolder generates most of the necessary code, you need to update your project to complete the process. This document explains the steps needed to complete an Identity scaffolding update.

We recommend using a source control system that shows file differences and allows you to back out of changes. Inspect the changes after running the Identity scaffolder.

Services are required when using [Two Factor Authentication](xref:security/authentication/identity-enable-qrcodes), [Account confirmation and password recovery](xref:security/authentication/accconfirm), and other security features with Identity. Services or service stubs aren't generated when scaffolding Identity. Services to enable these features must be added manually. For example, see [Require Email Confirmation](xref:security/authentication/accconfirm#require-email-confirmation).

When scaffolding Identity with a new data context into a project with existing individual accounts:

* In `Startup.ConfigureServices`, remove the calls to:
  * `AddDbContext`
  * `AddDefaultIdentity`

For example, `AddDbContext` and `AddDefaultIdentity` are commented out in the following code:

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/3.1sample/StartupRemove.cs?name=snippet)]

The preceeding code comments out the code that is duplicated in *Areas/Identity/IdentityHostingStartup.cs*

Typically, apps that were created with individual accounts should ***not*** create a new data context.

## Scaffold identity into an empty project

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/id-scaffold-dlg.md)]

Update the `Startup` class with code similar to the following:

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/3.1sample/StartupMVC.cs?name=snippet)]

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/hsts.md)]

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/migrations.md)]

## Scaffold identity into a Razor project without existing authorization

<!--  Updated for 3.0
set projNam=RPnoAuth
set projType=webapp

dotnet new %projType% -o %projNam%
cd %projNam%
dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design

-->

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/id-scaffold-dlg.md)]

Identity is configured in *Areas/Identity/IdentityHostingStartup.cs*. for more information, see [IHostingStartup](xref:fundamentals/configuration/platform-specific-configuration).

<a name="efm"></a>

### Migrations, UseAuthentication, and layout

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/migrations.md)]

<a name="useauthentication"></a>

### Enable authentication

Update the `Startup` class with code similar to the following:

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/3.1sample/StartupRP.cs?name=snippet)]

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/hsts.md)]

### Layout changes

Optional: Add the login partial (`_LoginPartial`) to the layout file:

[!code-html[Main](scaffold-identity/3.1sample/_Layout.cshtml?highlight=20)]

## Scaffold identity into a Razor project with authorization

<!--
Use >=2.1: dotnet new webapp -au Individual -o RPauth
Use = 2.0: dotnet new razor -au Individual -o RPauth
uld option: Use Local DB, not SQLite

dotnet new webapp -au Individual -uld -o RPauth
cd RPauth
dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity -dc RPauth.Data.ApplicationDbContext --files "Account.Register;Account.Register"
-->

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/id-scaffold-dlg-auth.md)]
Some Identity options are configured in *Areas/Identity/IdentityHostingStartup.cs*. For more information, see [IHostingStartup](xref:fundamentals/configuration/platform-specific-configuration).

## Scaffold identity into an MVC project without existing authorization

<!--
set projNam=MvcNoAuth
set projType=mvc
set version=2.1.0

dotnet new %projType% -o %projNam%
cd %projNam%
dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design -v %version%
dotnet restore
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity --useDefaultUI
dotnet ef migrations add CreateIdentitySchema
dotnet ef database update
-->

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/id-scaffold-dlg.md)]

Optional: Add the login partial (`_LoginPartial`) to the *Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml* file:

[!code-html[Main](scaffold-identity/3.1sample/_Layout.cshtml?highlight=20)]

* Move the *Pages/Shared/_LoginPartial.cshtml* file to *Views/Shared/_LoginPartial.cshtml*

Identity is configured in *Areas/Identity/IdentityHostingStartup.cs*. For more information, see IHostingStartup.

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/migrations.md)]

Update the `Startup` class with code similar to the following:

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/3.1sample/StartupMVC.cs?name=snippet)]

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/hsts.md)]

## Scaffold identity into an MVC project with authorization

<!--
dotnet new mvc -au Individual -o MvcAuth
cd MvcAuth
dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design
dotnet restore
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity -dc MvcAuth.Data.ApplicationDbContext  --files "Account.Login;Account.Register"
-->

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/id-scaffold-dlg-auth.md)]

<a name="full"></a>

## Create full identity UI source

To maintain full control of the Identity UI, run the Identity scaffolder and select **Override all files**.

The following highlighted code shows the changes to replace the default Identity UI with Identity in an ASP.NET Core 2.1 web app. You might want to do this to have full control of the Identity UI.

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/sample/StartupFull.cs?name=snippet1&highlight=13-14,17-999)]

The default Identity is replaced in the following code:

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/sample/StartupFull.cs?name=snippet2)]

The following code sets the [LoginPath](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.cookies.cookieauthenticationoptions.loginpath), [LogoutPath](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.cookies.cookieauthenticationoptions.logoutpath), and [AccessDeniedPath](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.cookies.cookieauthenticationoptions.accessdeniedpath):

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/sample/StartupFull.cs?name=snippet3)]

Register an `IEmailSender` implementation, for example:

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/sample/StartupFull.cs?name=snippet4)]

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/sample/StartupFull.cs?name=snippet)]

<!--
uld option: Use Local DB, not SQLite

dotnet new webapp -au Individual -uld -o RPauth
cd RPauth
dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity -dc RPauth.Data.ApplicationDbContext --files "Account.Register;Account.Login;Account.RegisterConfirmation"
-->
## Disable register page

To disable user registration:

* Scaffold Identity. Include Account.Register, Account.Login, and Account.RegisterConfirmation. For example:

  ```dotnetcli
   dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity -dc RPauth.Data.ApplicationDbContext --files "Account.Register;Account.Login;Account.RegisterConfirmation"
  ```

* Update *Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Register.cshtml.cs* so users can't register from this endpoint:

  [!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/sample/Register.cshtml.cs?name=snippet)]

* Update *Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Register.cshtml* to be consistent with the preceding changes:

  [!code-cshtml[](scaffold-identity/sample/Register.cshtml)]

* Comment out or remove the registration link from *Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Login.cshtml*

```cshtml
@*
<p>
    <a asp-page="./Register" asp-route-returnUrl="@Model.ReturnUrl">Register as a new user</a>
</p>
*@
```

* Update the *Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/RegisterConfirmation* page.

  * Remove the code and links from the cshtml file.
  * Remove the confirmation code from the `PageModel`:

  ```csharp
   [AllowAnonymous]
    public class RegisterConfirmationModel : PageModel
    {
        public IActionResult OnGet()
        {  
            return Page();
        }
    }
  ```
  
### Use another app to add users

Provide a mechanism to add users outside the web app. Options to add users include:

* A dedicated admin web app.
* A console app.

The following code outlines one approach to adding users:

* A list of users is read into memory.
* A strong unique password is generated for each user.
* The user is added to the Identity database.
* The user is notified and told to change the password.

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/consoleAddUser/Program.cs?name=snippet)]

The following code outlines adding a user:

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/consoleAddUser/Data/SeedData.cs?name=snippet)]

A similar approach can be followed for production scenarios.

## Prevent publish of static Identity assets

To prevent publishing static Identity assets to the web root, see <xref:security/authentication/identity#prevent-publish-of-static-identity-assets>.

::: moniker range="< aspnetcore-3.0"

ASP.NET Core 2.1 and later provides [ASP.NET Core Identity](xref:security/authentication/identity) as a [Razor Class Library](xref:razor-pages/ui-class). Applications that include Identity can apply the scaffolder to selectively add the source code contained in the Identity Razor Class Library (RCL). You might want to generate source code so you can modify the code and change the behavior. For example, you could instruct the scaffolder to generate the code used in registration. Generated code takes precedence over the same code in the Identity RCL. To gain full control of the UI and not use the default RCL, see the section [Create full identity UI source](#full).

Applications that do **not** include authentication can apply the scaffolder to add the RCL Identity package. You have the option of selecting Identity code to be generated.

Although the scaffolder generates most of the necessary code, you'll have to update your project to complete the process. This document explains the steps needed to complete an Identity scaffolding update.

When the Identity scaffolder is run, a *ScaffoldingReadme.txt* file is created in the project directory. The *ScaffoldingReadme.txt* file contains general instructions on what's needed to complete the Identity scaffolding update. This document contains more complete instructions than the *ScaffoldingReadme.txt* file.

We recommend using a source control system that shows file differences and allows you to back out of changes. Inspect the changes after running the Identity scaffolder.
