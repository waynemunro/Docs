# Secure an ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly standalone app with the Authentication library

To create a Blazor WebAssembly standalone app that uses `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication` library, execute the following command in a command shell:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new blazorwasm -au Individual
```

To specify the output location, which creates a project folder if it doesn't exist, include the output option in the command with a path (for example, `-o BlazorSample`). The folder name also becomes part of the project's name.

In Visual Studio, [create a Blazor WebAssembly app](xref:blazor/get-started). Set **Authentication** to **Individual User Accounts** with the **Store user accounts in-app** option.

## Authentication package

When an app is created to use Individual User Accounts, the app automatically receives a package reference for the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication` package in the app's project file. The package provides a set of primitives that help the app authenticate users and obtain tokens to call protected APIs.

If adding authentication to an app, manually add the package to the app's project file:

```xml
<PackageReference 
    Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication" 
    Version="{VERSION}" />
```

Replace `{VERSION}` in the preceding package reference with the version of the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Templates` package shown in the <xref:blazor/get-started> article.

## Authentication service support

Support for authenticating users is registered in the service container with the `AddOidcAuthentication` extension method provided by the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication` package. This method sets up all of the services required for the app to interact with the Identity Provider (IP).

*Program.cs*:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOidcAuthentication(options =>
{
    builder.Configuration.Bind("Local", options.ProviderOptions);
});
```

Configuration is supplied by the *wwwroot/appsettings.json* file:

```json
{
    "Local": {
        "Authority": "{AUTHORITY}",
        "ClientId": "{CLIENT ID}"
    }
}
```

Authentication support for standalone apps is offered using Open ID Connect (OIDC). The `AddOidcAuthentication` method accepts a callback to configure the parameters required to authenticate an app using OIDC. The values required for configuring the app can be obtained from the OIDC-compliant IP. Obtain the values when you register the app, which typically occurs in their online portal.

## Access token scopes

The Blazor WebAssembly template doesn't automatically configure the app to request an access token for a secure API. To provision an access token as part of the sign-in flow, add the scope to the default token scopes of the `OidcProviderOptions`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOidcAuthentication(options =>
{
    ...
    options.ProviderOptions.DefaultScopes.Add("{SCOPE URI}");
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the Azure portal provides a scope URI and **the app throws an unhandled exception** when it receives a *401 Unauthorized* response from the API, try using a scope URI that doesn't include the scheme and host. For example, the Azure portal may provide one of the following scope URI formats:
>
> * `https://{ORGANIZATION}.onmicrosoft.com/{API CLIENT ID OR CUSTOM VALUE}/{SCOPE NAME}`
> * `api://{API CLIENT ID OR CUSTOM VALUE}/{SCOPE NAME}`
>
> Supply the scope URI without the scheme and host:
>
> ```csharp
> options.ProviderOptions.DefaultScopes.Add(
>     "{API CLIENT ID OR CUSTOM VALUE}/{SCOPE NAME}");
> ```
