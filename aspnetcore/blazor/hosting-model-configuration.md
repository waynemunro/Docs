This article covers hosting model configuration.

## Blazor WebAssembly

### Environment

When running an app locally, the environment defaults to Development. When the app is published, the environment defaults to Production.

A hosted Blazor WebAssembly app picks up the environment from the server via a middleware that communicates the environment to the browser by adding the `blazor-environment` header. The value of the header is the environment. The hosted Blazor app and the server app share the same environment. For more information, including how to configure the environment, see <xref:fundamentals/environments>.

For a standalone app running locally, the development server adds the `blazor-environment` header to specify the Development environment. To specify the environment for other hosting environments, add the `blazor-environment` header.

In the following example for IIS, add the custom header to the published *web.config* file. The *web.config* file is located in the *bin/Release/{TARGET FRAMEWORK}/publish* folder:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>

    ...

    <httpProtocol>
      <customHeaders>
        <add name="blazor-environment" value="Staging" />
      </customHeaders>
    </httpProtocol>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

> [!NOTE]
> To use a custom *web.config* file for IIS that isn't overwritten when the app is published to the *publish* folder, see <xref:host-and-deploy/blazor/webassembly#use-a-custom-webconfig>.

Obtain the app's environment in a component by injecting `IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment` and reading the `Environment` property:

```razor
@page "/"
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting
@inject IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment HostEnvironment

<h1>Environment example</h1>

<p>Environment: @HostEnvironment.Environment</p>
```

During startup, the `WebAssemblyHostBuilder` exposes the `IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment` through the `HostEnvironment` property, which enables developers to have environment-specific logic in their code:

```csharp
if (builder.HostEnvironment.Environment == "Custom")
{
    ...
};
```

The following convenience extension methods permit checking the current environment for Development, Production, Staging, and custom environment names:

* `IsDevelopment()`
* `IsProduction()`
* `IsStaging()`
* `IsEnvironment("{ENVIRONMENT NAME}")

```csharp
if (builder.HostEnvironment.IsStaging())
{
    ...
};

if (builder.HostEnvironment.IsEnvironment("Custom"))
{
    ...
};
```

The `IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment.BaseAddress` property can be used during startup when the `NavigationManager` service isn't available.

### Configuration

Blazor WebAssembly supports configuration from:

* The [File Configuration Provider](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index#file-configuration-provider) for app settings files by default:
  * *wwwroot/appsettings.json*
  * *wwwroot/appsettings.{ENVIRONMENT}.json*
* Other [configuration providers](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index) registered by the app.

> [!WARNING]
> Configuration in a Blazor WebAssembly app is visible to users. **Don't store app secrets or credentials in configuration.**

For more information on configuration providers, see <xref:fundamentals/configuration/index>.

#### App settings configuration

*wwwroot/appsettings.json*:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello from config!"
}
```

Inject an <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.IConfiguration> instance into a component to access the configuration data:

```razor
@page "/"
@using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
@inject IConfiguration Configuration

<h1>Configuration example</h1>

<p>Message: @Configuration["message"]</p>
```

#### Provider configuration

The following example uses a <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Memory.MemoryConfigurationSource> and the [File Configuration Provider](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index#file-configuration-provider) to supply additional configuration:

`Program.Main`:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

...

var vehicleData = new Dictionary<string, string>()
{
    { "color", "blue" },
    { "type", "car" },
    { "wheels:count", "3" },
    { "wheels:brand", "Blazin" },
    { "wheels:brand:type", "rally" },
    { "wheels:year", "2008" },
};

var memoryConfig = new MemoryConfigurationSource { InitialData = vehicleData };

...

builder.Configuration
    .Add(memoryConfig)
    .AddJsonFile("cars.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: true);
```

Inject an <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.IConfiguration> instance into a component to access the configuration data:

```razor
@page "/"
@using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
@inject IConfiguration Configuration

<h1>Configuration example</h1>

<h2>Wheels</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Count: @Configuration["wheels:count"]</p>
    <li>Brand: @Configuration["wheels:brand"]</p>
    <li>Type: @Configuration["wheels:brand:type"]</p>
    <li>Year: @Configuration["wheels:year"]</p>
</ul>

@code {
    var wheelsSection = Configuration.GetSection("wheels");
    
    ...
}
```

#### Authentication configuration

*wwwroot/appsettings.json*:

```json
{
  "AzureAD": {
    "Authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    "ClientId": "aeaebf0f-d416-4d92-a08f-e1d5b51fc494"
  }
}
```

`Program.Main`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOidcAuthentication(options =>
    builder.Configuration.Bind("AzureAD", options);
```

#### Logging configuration

*wwwroot/appsettings.json*:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```

`Program.Main`:

```csharp
builder.Logging.AddConfiguration(
    builder.Configuration.GetSection("Logging"));
```

#### Host builder configuration

`Program.Main`:

```csharp
var hostname = builder.Configuration["HostName"];
```

#### Cached configuration

Configuration files are cached for offline use. With [Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)](xref:blazor/progressive-web-app), you can only update configuration files when creating a new deployment. Editing configuration files between deployments has no effect because:

* Users have cached versions of the files that they continue to use.
* The PWA's *service-worker.js* and *service-worker-assets.js* files must be rebuilt on compilation, which signal to the app on the user's next online visit that the app has been redeployed.

For more information on how background updates are handled by PWAs, see <xref:blazor/progressive-web-app#background-updates>.

### Logging

## Blazor Server

### Reflect the connection state in the UI

When the client detects that the connection has been lost, a default UI is displayed to the user while the client attempts to reconnect. If reconnection fails, the user is provided the option to retry.

To customize the UI, define an element with an `id` of `components-reconnect-modal` in the `<body>` of the *_Host.cshtml* Razor page:

```cshtml
<div id="components-reconnect-modal">
    ...
</div>
```

The following table describes the CSS classes applied to the `components-reconnect-modal` element.

| CSS class                       | Indicates&hellip; |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `components-reconnect-show`     | A lost connection. The client is attempting to reconnect. Show the modal. |
| `components-reconnect-hide`     | An active connection is re-established to the server. Hide the modal. |
| `components-reconnect-failed`   | Reconnection failed, probably due to a network failure. To attempt reconnection, call `window.Blazor.reconnect()`. |
| `components-reconnect-rejected` | Reconnection rejected. The server was reached but refused the connection, and the user's state on the server is lost. To reload the app, call `location.reload()`. This connection state may result when:<ul><li>A crash in the server-side circuit occurs.</li><li>The client is disconnected long enough for the server to drop the user's state. Instances of the components that the user is interacting with are disposed.</li><li>The server is restarted, or the app's worker process is recycled.</li></ul> |

### Render mode

Blazor Server apps are set up by default to prerender the UI on the server before the client connection to the server is established. This is set up in the *_Host.cshtml* Razor page:

```cshtml
<body>
    <app>
      <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
    </app>

    <script src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>
</body>
```

`RenderMode` configures whether the component:

* Is prerendered into the page.
* Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

| `RenderMode`        | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| `ServerPrerendered` | Renders the component into static HTML and includes a marker for a Blazor Server app. When the user-agent starts, this marker is used to bootstrap a Blazor app. |
| `Server`            | Renders a marker for a Blazor Server app. Output from the component isn't included. When the user-agent starts, this marker is used to bootstrap a Blazor app. |
| `Static`            | Renders the component into static HTML. |

Rendering server components from a static HTML page isn't supported.

### Configure the SignalR client for Blazor Server apps

Sometimes, you need to configure the SignalR client used by Blazor Server apps. For example, you might want to configure logging on the SignalR client to diagnose a connection issue.

To configure the SignalR client in the *Pages/_Host.cshtml* file:

* Add an `autostart="false"` attribute to the `<script>` tag for the `blazor.server.js` script.
* Call `Blazor.start` and pass in a configuration object that specifies the SignalR builder.

```html
<script src="_framework/blazor.server.js" autostart="false"></script>
<script>
  Blazor.start({
    configureSignalR: function (builder) {
      builder.configureLogging("information"); // LogLevel.Information
    }
  });
</script>
```
